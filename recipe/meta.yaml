  description: |
    The GNU implementation of awk is called gawk; if you invoke it with the
    proper options or environment variables, it is fully compatible with the
    POSIX1 specification of the awk language and with the Unix version of awk
    maintained by Brian Kernighan. This means that all properly written awk
    programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish
    between gawk and other awk implementations.
